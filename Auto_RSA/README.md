# RSA - Stock Buying Automation

Automate the purchase of a stock ticker across multiple different brokrages. 

The program will prompt you with a dialogue before executing the auto-touch program and automating the set-up to the order page, where manually intervention will be required to prevent any mistakes. 

Currently, robinhood is the only platform I have finished (with improvements incoming soon), with sofi/public being more 50/50. Others will slowly be added in the future.



Status: Incomplete project.
