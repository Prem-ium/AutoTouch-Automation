# iOS AutoTouch Projects

My personal collection of AutoTouch scripts to automate tasks on mobile.

## Featured Projects:
### Taco Bell
Automate the creation of a brand new Taco Bell Rewards account, which provides the benefit of receiving coupons and freebie meals. Paired extremely well when used with Jailbreak tweaks such as Slices to create an infinite number of accounts.
### Govee
Automate daily tasks that earn rewards. Requires an album of videos in the photos app. Script automates daily comment on video, comment on post, and daily video upload to earn Govee points which can be redeemed for Govee Lights.
### Auto RSA
Non-maintained. [Replaced with this repository.](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Sofi-AutoTrade) Automate the purchase of any Stock Ticker. Supported Robinhood, Sofi, and Public before being unmaintained. 
### SHEIN
A simple script which attempts to complete daily check-in for the purpose of accruing reward points.
